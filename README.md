# 42-minishell Summary
42's project that aims to recreate a little shell from scratch, in C, and reproducing the behavior of bash.

# Mandatory Instructions
We add to implement the following features:
 - Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
 - Have a working history.
 - Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path).
 - Not use more than one global variable.
 - Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).
 - Handle â€™ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-characters in the quoted sequence.
 - Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-characters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
 - Implement redirections: <, >, << and >>.
 - Implement pipes.
 - Handle environment variables which should expand to their values.
 - Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
 - Handle signals ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
 - The following builtins:
 echo with option -n
 cd with only a relative or absolute path
 pwd with no options
 export with no options
 unset with no options
 env with no options or arguments
 exit with no options
 - Follow the 42's norm of code (a set of rules to standardize the way our code is written).
 - Use only the allowed functions.

# How to Use
Clone the repository in the location of your choice, then compile using make command:
```
cd 42-minishell
make
```
Launch minishell! You can use the command make leak to launch it using valgrind to detect memory issues like leaks.
```
./minishell
```
or
```
make leak
```
Enjoy!
